# Fake Instagram Account Detection

The purpose of this project is to utilize a deep neural network model to detect spam accounts on Instagram. Exploratory data analysis was performed, determining that fake accounts tend to have long usernames and no profile pictures, among other characterstics. We built and trained a deep learning model that predicted fake accounts with high accuracy. We ensured the model did not overfit the training data.
